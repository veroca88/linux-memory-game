            Rules of the game
            <hr />
            <p>
              This is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down
              and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of
              the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. You have two
              levels, This is your last chance to decide which level you want to
              play. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue
              pill—the story goes easy. You take the red pill—you stay in
              Wonderland, and the story goes difficult.
